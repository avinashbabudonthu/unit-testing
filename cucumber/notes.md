# Notes

* cucumber does not automate test cases
* We use `Gherkin` syntax to write test cases

# Why cucumber?
* Data driven test cases
* Paramterized test cases
* Execution control
* Hooks
	* Some tests are identified as regression then we can execute only those regression test cases
* Reports

# Terminologies
